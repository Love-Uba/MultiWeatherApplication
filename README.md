# MultiWeatherApplication

* App Description: Shows your local weather, forecasts the weather in the area as well as a search functionality for the weather of other areas

          •⁠  ⁠Shows user the weather conditions and forecast of their current location.
          •⁠  ⁠Allows user to search for a city, access its weather conditions and forecast.
          •⁠  ⁠Allows User to save/remove both current or searched location they desire to save as favourites and manage favourite cities.

* Design decisions: Although this is relatively a small application, every good practice starts from sticking to the possiblity of an expansion, so i adopted a Clean Architectural set up with an Independent Domains, UseCases, Viewmodels and Fragments. This enables a clean flow of data from the source (managed by the repository's local/remote sources) to the views.
A lot of interface was used to aid the testing process and enable full coverage.

* Challenges faced: Time constraint and No proper provision on the remote data source.

* How the challenges were addressed: I prioritized the key features, although there still wasn't enough time for adequate testing and optimizations. For the remote source, i had to make do with what was available in the time alotted, with more time i would have accounted for the remote lapses in my local source.
